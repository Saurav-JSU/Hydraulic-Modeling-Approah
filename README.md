I need help fixing calculation bugs in a hydraulic modeling Python package while maintaining API compatibility.

Please provide code fixes that:

Maintain all function signatures and return types to preserve API compatibility
Fix only the internal calculation logic without changing the structure
Include comments explaining the physical reasoning behind the fixes
Handle edge cases appropriately
Ensure physically realistic hydraulic behavior while keeping all visualization components functional
Do not compromise on computational accuracyâ€”use full, detailed equations if necessary to ensure correctness
Provide the full corrected code, ready to copy and use
I will provide all the code sections one by one for review and correction.
